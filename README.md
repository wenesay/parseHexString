# parseHexString
DatatypeConverter.parseHexBinary in Javascript

# Motivation
While duplicating code for my Javascript project from Java code, I came across a requirement which required me to duplicate of DatatypeConverter.parseHexBinary for Javascript.

A lot of searching and using samples failed to match the Java output. Finally I had to open the Java code and replace it with Javascript code.\

# Usage
```
parseHexString(theString)
```
